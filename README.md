# VibeAround

**Your AI coding agents, always around.**

Run AI coding agents side by side on your computer. Control them from anywhere, continue previous sessions, and preview what they build.

VibeAround is a unified AI Agent workspace.

Launch Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Pi, OpenCode, Claude Desktop, Codex Desktop and more directly or with 3rd party AI APIs. Start or continue previous sessions from the command line, browser, mobile messaging apps, or a Web Terminal. Preview what agents build, from dev servers to Markdown, HTML, and generated artifacts.

## Why VibeAround

AI coding work is split across agents, model APIs, terminals, messaging apps, browsers, and preview URLs. VibeAround keeps the work together while the agents still run on your computer.

- Start the right agent with the right model profile, without editing each agent's config files.
- Keep Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Pi, OpenCode and more reachable from one workspace.
- Continue the same sessions from desktop, web, mobile, messaging apps, or a Web Terminal.
- Preview local dev servers, Markdown, HTML, and generated artifacts without moving execution to a cloud server.

## Agent Launch

Launch the right agent with the right model.

Pick an AI agent, model profile or API endpoint, and workspace. VibeAround launches Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Pi, OpenCode, Claude Desktop, Codex Desktop and more with 3rd party AI APIs, without changing each agent's own config files, skills, MCP servers, workflow, or project context.

</p>

- Launch AI coding agents and desktop apps like Claude and Codex from one desktop UI.
- Choose agent, model profile, API endpoint, workspace, terminal, and session before launch.
- Start new sessions or continue previous sessions.
- Use direct launch or profile-based launch, including profile overlays for Claude Desktop and Codex Desktop.
- Keep each agent's own config files, workflow, and project context.

## API Profiles & Bridge

Use more model providers with the AI agents you prefer. Save provider keys, base URLs, models, and aliases as profiles; when an agent and a provider speak different API shapes, VibeAround's local bridge translates between them.

```text
Agent-facing API shapes             VibeAround API Bridge               Provider API shapes
+-------------------------+         +-----------------------------+      +-------------------------+
| OpenAI Responses        | ----\   | profile-scoped local routes |  /-> | OpenAI Responses        |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | -----\  | model aliases and metadata  | /--> | OpenAI Chat Completions |
| Anthropic Messages      | ------> | request/response translate  | ---> | Anthropic Messages      |
| Gemini Generate Content | -----/  | va-ai-api-bridge (VAAAB)    | \--> | Gemini Generate Content |
+-------------------------+         +-----------------------------+      +-------------------------+
```

The bridge is powered by [va-ai-api-bridge](https://github.com/jazzenchen/va-ai-api-bridge), the standalone VAAAB project behind VibeAround's API translation.

| API shape | Common endpoint |
|---|---|
| OpenAI Responses | `/v1/responses` |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | `/v1/chat/completions` |
| Anthropic Messages | `/v1/messages` |
| Gemini Generate Content | `/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` |

Built-in provider presets include DeepSeek, Alibaba DashScope, Moonshot / Kimi, MiniMax, Xiaomi MiMo, xAI / Grok, NVIDIA NIM, Z.AI / GLM, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Azure OpenAI, and custom endpoints.

- Save API settings with keys, base URLs, models, aliases, and metadata.
- Bridge OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, and Gemini Generate Content shapes.
- Run the same AI agent with different API profiles across sessions.

## Unified Workspace

One workspace for every AI agent.

Coordinate agents and sessions from a single workspace. Run agents side by side, or as a team.

## Local-first Security

VibeAround keeps AI coding work on your computer by default.

- Agents run on your computer.
- Provider credentials stay in local VibeAround settings/profile storage.
- The daemon listens on loopback unless you explicitly enable a tunnel.
- Dashboard APIs and WebSocket routes require a local auth token.
- Public tunnel URLs require browser pairing.
- Preview links are scoped and short-lived.
- Agent CLIs use your local project permissions.

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest desktop package for your platform.
2. Open VibeAround and complete onboarding.
3. Enable the agent CLIs you use.
4. Add API profiles if you want VibeAround to route model traffic.
5. Pick an agent, model profile, terminal, workspace, and session from Launch.
6. Continue from desktop, Web Chat, Web Terminal, or a configured messaging channel.

### Migration Guide From 0.6.x

v0.7.3 changes Startkit state, detected agent sources, desktop launch targets, and profile launch settings. If you are upgrading from 0.6.x, do a clean local-state migration:

1. Quit VibeAround.
2. Make a full backup of the old `~/.vibearound` directory.
3. Remove the old `~/.vibearound` directory.
4. Restore only durable state from the backup.
5. Launch VibeAround v0.7.3 and rerun onboarding / Startkit setup if Launch, profile, Startkit, or desktop-agent settings look stale.

Restore these durable items only: `settings.json`, `profiles/`, `google-oauth/`, `agents.json`, `launcher.json`, `state/`, `sessions/`, `launch-session-archive.json`, `workspaces/`, and `worktrees/`.

Do not restore generated or runtime data such as `.cache/`, `cache/startkit/`, `agents.detected.json`, `desktop-apps.detected.json`, `profile-state/`, `api-bridge/launches/`, `logs/`, `npm-global/`, `plugins/`, `bin/`, `runtime/`, or `auth.json`.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
set -euo pipefail

BACKUP="$HOME/vibearound-0.6-full-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"
SOURCE="$HOME/.vibearound"

if [ -d "$SOURCE" ]; then
  cp -a "$SOURCE" "$BACKUP"
  rm -rf "$SOURCE"
fi

mkdir -p "$SOURCE"

for item in settings.json profiles google-oauth agents.json launcher.json state sessions launch-session-archive.json workspaces worktrees; do
  [ -e "$BACKUP/$item" ] && cp -a "$BACKUP/$item" "$SOURCE/"
done
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

$Backup = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ("vibearound-0.6-full-backup-" + (Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMddHHmmss"))
$SourceRoot = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ".vibearound"

if (Test-Path $SourceRoot) {
  Copy-Item $SourceRoot $Backup -Recurse -Force
  Remove-Item $SourceRoot -Recurse -Force
}

New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $SourceRoot | Out-Null

$Items = @(
  "settings.json", "profiles", "google-oauth", "agents.json", "launcher.json",
  "state", "sessions", "launch-session-archive.json", "workspaces", "worktrees"
)

foreach ($Item in $Items) {
  $Source = Join-Path $Backup $Item
  if (Test-Path $Source) { Copy-Item $Source $SourceRoot -Recurse -Force }
}
```

## Develop Locally

```bash
cd src
bun install
bun run prebuild
bun run dev
```

Prerequisites: Rust 1.82+, Bun 1.3+, and Node.js 24 LTS recommended. macOS also needs Xcode command line tools; Linux needs the WebKitGTK/Tauri system dependencies for your distribution.
