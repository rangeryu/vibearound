//! Subprocess management.
//!
//! - [`env`]: builds `Command`s with the user's full login-shell environment
//!   injected, so GUI-launched Tauri apps inherit `PATH` / NVM / API keys.
//! - [`registry`]: takes ownership of every spawned `Child` in a global
//!   table so daemon shutdown can synchronously SIGKILL them regardless of
//!   tokio task-poll order. Used by the supervisor + legacy call sites.
//! - [`supervisor`]: the unified lifecycle layer — spawn, restart, status,
//!   structured logging — shared by channel plugins, ACP agents, tunnels,
//!   and (future) PTY.
//! - [`bridge`]: manager-side trait for driving a protocol over the stdio
//!   pipes the supervisor hands back.
//! - [`error`]: `ProcessError` at the supervisor boundary.
