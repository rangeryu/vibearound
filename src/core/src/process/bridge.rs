//! `ProcessBridge` — the manager-owned half of a supervised subprocess.
//!
//! The supervisor owns the `Child` and everything lifecycle-related (spawn,
//! kill, restart, status broadcast). When a child is spawned, the supervisor
//! calls a caller-supplied `BridgeFactory` to build a fresh `ProcessBridge`,
//! then hands over the stdio pipes by calling `run()`. The bridge runs the
//! protocol (ACP, URL parsing, whatever) until the pipes close or the cancel
//! token fires, then returns a `BridgeExit`.
//!
//! A bridge is **one-shot**: the factory is invoked again for each respawn.
//! Protocol-level state that must survive restart (e.g. ACP session_id) is
//! the manager's job to thread through the factory closure.
