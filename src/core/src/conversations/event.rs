//! System events emitted by ConversationManager for lifecycle observability.
//!
//! ACP protocol events (streaming tokens, tool calls) flow through the
//! AgentClientHandler chain and do NOT appear here.
//!
//! There is intentionally no `StateChanged` / `SnapshotChanged` event on
//! this channel. Consumers that need the current state of a conversation
//! read it live via `ConversationManager::list()` +
//! `Conversation::state().await`. The event stream is only for discrete
//! lifecycle milestones (route created, session ready, agent initialized,
//! etc.).
