//! `StdioPluginRuntime` — the routing-side half of an stdio plugin.
//!
//! After the PR2 migration, this type is intentionally small. It only
//! carries the output sender that `PluginHost::send_output` writes to;
//! the supervisor owns the `Child` and the bridge thread owns the
//! receiver. Each time the plugin is (re)spawned, a fresh runtime is
//! built with a fresh `(output_tx, output_rx)` pair and registered via
//! `PluginHost::replace_stdio_runtime` so routing always points at the
//! live bridge.
